he does not hesitate to employ words and figures that suggest 1
the earlier tragedians rather than the comedians.

47. Cicero, in his later years, professed contempt for the
whole tribe of these poetae noui (like Catullus and his friends)
who had forsaken all the traditions 01 Ε11111113 (Or. 161 3 Tusc.
III. 453 Art. VII. 2. 1); and Horace mentions Catullus but
once, and then with definite disparagement (Sat. I. 10. 19);
11111 even from these references it may be fairly inferred that ,
the poetry of Catullus was well 3ηά acceptably known among ¹
his immediate generation 01 Romans, 3ηά had not to 11311 till
the time of the elegiasts for a purely posthumous fame. It
was, indeed, not so very long 31131 his death that Cornelius
Nepos ventured to rank him 111 quality alongside Lucretius
(Art. 12. 4). His fame, then, was contemporary with him-
self. But even a cursory examination of his extant book of
poems shows evidence that it was not published till after the
poet’s death. For although it has come down 10 us mutilated
by the accidente 01 time in a most unseemly manner, no muti-
lation can account 101 the condition 01 c. 58⁶, which is clearly ·
but a rejected trial-sketch for the poem afterward elaborated 33
c. 5531111 not a misplaced part 01 c. 55 113311 (note the much
greater frequency 01 dactyls in the second place in the verses 01
c. 58δ than 01 c. 55). Would Catullus himself have published
such amere fragment? Still more, would he after the recon-
ciliation with Julius Caesar have published, or republished‚ the
poems in which Caesar is bitterly assailed? For this same reason,
if forno other, it is also impossible to suppose, with certain
critics, that Catullus himself arranged the book 101 publication,
but was overtaken by death before it was actually published.

48. The only satisfactory hypothesis is that the book was
both arranged and published, after the author’s death, by some
literary friend of his at Rome, where he ordinarily kept his

books and papers (cf. c. 68. 33-36). The posthumous editor
arranged the poems in three general groups. First come sirty
