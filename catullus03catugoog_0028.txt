wholly evil, a beart that could feel such an impulse, even toward
a mistaken object.

25. But however gentle his treatment of lesbia, the rivals of
Catullus found now no mercy at his hands. For them be had
but bitter scom and anger, since he mistakenly regarded them,
and not Lesbia herself, as responsible for her downfall. Egna-
tius and his set of companions (cc. 37, 39), Gellius (cc. 74, 80,
88, 89, 90, 116), perhaps also AEmilius (c. 97), Victius (c. 98),
and Cominius (c. 108), and other unnamed lovers (cc. 71, 78⁵)
suffer on this account from the stinging lash of his satire. Even
Caelius Rufus, like Quintius an early friend of the poet (c. roo),
and like Quintius the subjectos remonstrance a short time be-
fore (cc. 77, 82), now finds no such gentle treatment (cc. 69,
yri). Possibly, also, the apparent fling at Hortensius in c.
95. 3, who was most kindly addressed in c. 65, may have been
prompted by personal rather than by professional jealousy.
Most significant, too (cf. ς 28), is the bolt aimed at a certain
Lesbius (c. 79).

26. The delights of vengeance were perhaps sweet, but they
did not bring Catullus peace. The torment of his passion was
still raging within him, and from that he longed to find free-
dom, not again in the arms of his mistress, but in victory over
himself. For this he prayed most earnestly (c. 76), and this he
finally attained, aided partly, no doubt, by absence from the
country (cf. § 29), but more by the persistency with which he
kept up the struggle within himself. It may well be, however,
that in these months of mental anguish are to be found the
beginnings of that disease that caused his untimely death. But
the conviction evidently grew upon him that Lesbia had not
been led astray by his false friends, but had always been deceit·
ful above all things, and with the clearer insight carne not onlya
gentler feeling toward the men he had judged traitors to friend·
ship (cf. ag. c. 58 to Caelius Rufus), but a horror and con·
tempt, now unmixed with pity, for Lesbia herself. And when
she tried once more, in the day of his reconciliation with Caesar,
