d. Hmrrrs in thesis is found in cc. 66. ιι neue auctam 68.
158 petino omma,· 107. r capelle optantr'. In cc. ²7· 4, 66. 48,
and 97. a, it occursio the MSS„ but not in the emended text
ltere presented. Hiatus in arsis occurs in cc. 10. ²7 mane
r‘nqufi‚· 55. 4 te in: 97. 1 diamenn 114. 6 dome ipse.

e. Svsrona of finale is not uncommon, especially in verbs.

In 10. 26 commoda (imperative) occurs.

J? Dnsrom occursio cc. 64. 3⁶0 tepefactet, and 90. 6 64κέ-
sacr'ens (but cf. 68. ²9 tepefactet).

g. In c. 116. 8 dabis final s does not make position with the l
lnitial consonant following ; and in c. 23. 27 the reading of V, l
sate‘s beatus, is probably correct, representing satir beatu's (ie. ἵ
beatus es). In cc. 62. 4, 64. 20, and 66. 11 a final syllable
ending in a single consonant is lengthened in thesis before ς
hymenaeus. Afinal syllable ending in a short vowel is thrice
lengthened in thesis before a mute followed by r (in cc. 4. 9
Proponeela trucem: 4. 18 impotentia freta ‚· ²9· 4 ultima
baranniam and it is noticeable that all these instances occur l
ln pure (Ρ) iambics. A similar syllable is lengthened in thesis ¹
before initials followed by a consonant in cc. 17. 24 pote
tlale'elum 22. 12 mede scurra ,· 44. 18 nefan'a serapem· 63. 53
gelida stabula ,· 64. 186 nulla spes ,· 67. 3² supposita speculae.
lint Catullus is not careful to follow out this rnle of position in
all caseS, any more than he is consistent in instances of systole
ttnd diastole, or in such cases as cc. 43. 2 nigrr's, but 68. 63
vtigra,· and especially 71. a podagra, but 71. 6 podagra. In
these minor matters he allows himself greater freedom than
nither Lucretius or the later poets, and the same liberty is
seen in the greater matters concemed with his treatment of
ttretres. His graceful command of rhythm was far removed
from the fixed formalities adopted by the Augustans.
