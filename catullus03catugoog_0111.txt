Alfene immemor atque unanimis false sodalibus,

Iam te nil miseret, dure, tui dulcis amiculi?

lam me prodere, iam non dubitas fallere, perfide?

Nec iacta impia fallacum hominum caelicolis placent ;
⁵ Quae tu neglegis, acme miserum deseris in malis.

Eheu, quid faciant, dic, homines, cuiue habeant fidem?
Certe tute iubebas animam tradere, inique, me
inducens in amorem, quasi tuta omnia mi forent.
Idem nunc retrahis te ac tua dicta omnia iactaque

ro Ventos irrita ferre ac nebulas aerias sinis.
