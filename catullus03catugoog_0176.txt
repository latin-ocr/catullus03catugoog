CATULLUS.

5 Deuoluit ili acuto sibi pondera silice.
Itaque ut relicta sensit sibi membra sine uiro,
Etiam recente terrae sola sanguine maculans
Niueis citata cepit manibus leue typanum,
Typanum, tubam Cybelles, tua, mater, initia,

gae, 72 nemoriuagres), aud the repe·
tition of words of agitated move-
ment and feeling (eg. rapidus three
times, citatus four times, citas twice,
rabidus three times, rabies once).

1. celeri: indicating his euger-
ness forarrival. ψ

2. Phrygium nemus2thatcloth·
ing the slopes not of Dindymus but
of Ida (cf. vv. 30, 52).-citato
cupide pede: emphasizing the
{tilithi{lthltltrtllt
reaching the shores of Asia (cf. vv.
47, 89); the poet is not writing as
a gieographer. Cf. v. 30 properante
pe e.

mi {exterrente it
trasted with the silent mysteries of
the abode of the goddess.

4. ibi, thereupon,· cf. vv. 42, 48,
76; and 66. 333 &bn—furenti
rabie: cf. v. 38 rabidus fieren—-
uagus animis: the plural to indi·
cate his divided‚ distorted emotions;
cf. Verg. Aee. VIII. 228 eccesarens
animis aderat Tirynthius.

5. ili: genitive from the stem
ilio, a rare but legitimate variant
for the more frequent ili-,· cis
Cels. lv, 1 iliis (dat. plur.); Gloss.
Labb. ilium λαγών ; Marc. Emp.
36 [ilium]¹

6. aine uiro: i.e. sine uirilitate.

7. terrae sola (plural, as in v. 40
sola dura): cf. Lucr. Il. 592 nam
multis succensa locis ardent sola
terrae.

8. niueis manibus: cf. v. 10 n.
teneris digitis. Adjectives descrip-
tive of feminine beauty are employed

to accord with the change of gendes
under which Attis is now spoken of,
and himself speaks of his compan-
ions (vv. 12 Gallae, 15 exsecutae, 34
rapidae Gallae); cf. Honssarm. ΙΙ,
4. 3 niueo colore (of Briseis) ς 111.
27. 25 niueum latur (of Europe);
Verg. Aen. VIII. 387 niueis lacertis
(of Venus). -citstaz Attis is from
henceforth a notha mulier (v. 27),
and is described by feminine adjec-
tives; cf. vv. 11 adorta, tremebunda,
31 fieribundo, 32 comitata, etc.;
but when he returns to himself and
thinks with sorrow and loathing
upon his condition, the masculine
adjective is resumed; cf. vv. 5¹
miser, 78 hunc, 88 tenerum, 89 ille.
The emendations by which all these
later masculines (except v. 78 hunc)
have been transformed to feminines
are based on incorrect feeling. —
leue: the tympanum is probably
called leue because it is cauum (v.
10).- typanurn: Gr. poet. form
τύπανον, metri gratia (cfv. 21, etc.
tympanum, Gr. τύμπανον) ; frum
representations in vase· and wall·
paintings, an instrument like the·
modern iambourine‚ but with the
rattling disks of metal suspended at
intervals from its edge by short
cords.

9. tubam Cybelles: as the blare
of the tuba is the summons and in-
citement to warriors, so is the beat
of the tympanum to the votaries
of Cybele; the phrase is further
explained by tua initia. The
famous norm of Bentley (on Lu-
can l. 600) that when the penult is
short the form Cybele should br
