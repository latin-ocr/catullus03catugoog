Transpadanes at Roma-some ol them making great names
sor themselves in the literary world. With some oi these cer·
tainly a man of station prominent enough in Verona to be
later, at least, the friend os Julius Caesar, might command
interest. Under the charge os one of them he might have
placed so promising a young 'man as his son doubtless was.
To which one the trust fell cannot now be determined, but as
Catullus later (c. r) addresses Cornelius Nepos as the friend
and foster-father oi his earlier poems, it seems not unlilrely
that to his guardianship (cf. 5 63) Catullus owed his introduc-
tion into the society of Rome.

13. The purpose oi his coming thither is nowhere stated,
but may easily be divined. Rome was the school oi Italy, at
least to all who could pay ior her tuition. Anda youth with a
poet's soul burning within him could hardly have been content
with such schooling as a Transpadane town afforded, even to
her wealthiest inhabitants. But whether Catullus did much
studying oi'a serious sort may well be doubted. It cannot be
quite true that his ‘only books were woman's looks,’ for his
poems show an ardent and sympathetic study of the Greek
poets. But his attainments in rhetoric and philosophy, ii he
had any at all, were certainly not oi a scholastic character, ¹and
he apparently never cared to follow the students of the day to
Athens orto Rhodes.

14. Not books, but llic, exercised over him the preliminent
charm. And this lit'e was not the lit'e oi the past, but of the
present—the busy, delirious whirl ol lile in the capital oi the
world. Into it he plunged with all the ardor os a lively and
passionate nature. Rome was from that first moment his
home, the centre oi all his beloved activities. Verona, his
Sabine villa, and even Sirmio, became to him but hospitals
or vacation haunts. Once only did he leave Italy, and even
his joy at reaching Sirmio again on his return (c. 31) could
not long detain him from Rome. And at Rome death met
him.
