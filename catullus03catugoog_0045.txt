not very long before, the year 47 ac. (cl. Cic. Fam. XV. 21,

though ot low stature (ci. 53. 53 Sen. Contr. VII. 4. 75 Ov.
T n'st. 11. 431), and as a writer oi epic, lyric, and epigram (ci.

the Q. Comiiicius to whom Cicero wrote friendly letters (Fam.
- XII. 17-3o)‚ dated between 45 and 43 ac. This Cornificius
was an active officer oi Julius Caesar, a member oi the col·
