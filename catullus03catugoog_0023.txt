ις. In lise at Rome, then, Catullus found his full develop

ment as a poet. Already from the donning of the toga uin'lis, r
so he tells us (c. 68. 15 ft), he had been busied with love and ’

love-verses. But whether this period antedated or followed hia
coming to Rome cannot be decided‚ since the date of publican
tion os the Chronica os Nepos (c. 1. 8) isunknown, and on this
alone could a decision os the other point be based. Such
poems as those that concern Aufilena (cc. roo,1ro, ιιι) may
possibly date from the Veronese period os the poet’s lit'e
(though c. 82 cannot possibly do so), and yet it is just as

possible that their scene was Rome (cl. introductory note to ἕ

c. roo), and the same may be said os the poems conceming

Ameana (cc. 41, 43). Much more likely is it, however, that ἵ

affairs cc. 17 and 67 date t'rom his residence in his native city,
while c. 35 was surely written during only a temporary visit
there (ci Commentary).

humor brought them forth. But at Rome, and not long alter

life, and beside the verses to which it gave birth the melodious
chamber ditties os Horace and the elaborated passions of the
elegiasts are but as tinkling cymbals. To the woman who exer-
cised this wonderful power over him he gives the name of lesbia.
But more often he is not content with a'name, and the familiar
terms os endearment flow from his lips with a newer and deeper
meaning; sor he delights to seel that though his experience
is on the outside like that of other men, his mistress is peerless
in virtues and his love sor her a love passing that os women.

On his side the passion was sudden and intense. He adopts¹
the words os Sappho, and tells Lesbia (c. ⁵1) of the deadly
