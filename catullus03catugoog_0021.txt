²¹¹⁰ tasi& and inclinatious of Catullus as the father of Horace
had with those of his son. Catullus, moreover, was not* the

¹0· Yet there was apparently wealth enough iu the family to
enable even the younger brother to enjoy the advantages that
iwealtb brought to the young Italian of that day. He was able
edrly 1n his young manhood to go to Rome, and to make that
cltl' thenceforth his abiding-place (c. 68. 34 ft). He owned a
vllla at Sirmio (c. 31), and another on the edgeof the Sabine i
hills (c. 44). inrisere is no indication that white at Rome ie
was, busy with any pursuit that could fill his purse, although,
’ like many another young Roman, he later obtained a provincial
appointment, and went to Bithynia on the staff of the governor
Memmius in the hope of wealth (cf. ξ ²9 ft). The hope, he
tells us (cc. 10, 28), proved abortive, but Catullus had yet
money enough—perhaps even to purchase a yacht for his
homeward journey like any millionnaire (cf. ἓ 35 and intro-
ductory note to c. 4) -at any rate to continue his merry life
at Rome, apparentlywithout great pecuniary embarrassment. Q
All these indications point to no financial inability or niggard- ’
liness on the part of his father. Possibly the villas, and an iu-
erease of income, came to him upon the death of his brother.

11. Whether Catullus, like Horace, was accompanied to
Rome by his father is doubtful> On the whole, it seems
hardly probable that he was. To say nothing of the con-
siderations possibly connected with the interests of the elder
son, the father was apparently resident in Verona at the time
when Julius Caesar was governor of Gaul (Suet. Iul. 73), and
this fact may indicate that at ,no time was the family home at
Vemua broken up in favor ofa new one at Rome.
