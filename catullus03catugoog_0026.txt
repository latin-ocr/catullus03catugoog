INTRODUCTION. xxi

trustful confidenee he had felt in Lesbia's full reciprocation
of his love was gone. He does reproduce his former tone of
joyous mirth in one poem celebrating the reconciliation (c. 36),
but when Lesbia appeals to the gods to bear witness to her
pledge of eternal fidelity (c. 109), though he joins in her
prayer, it is clearly not with hearty saith, but only with a some·
what reserved desire. And with more experienee, his heart is
becoming a little hardened. However jesting the tone may be
interpreted in which he answers Lesbia's protestations (c. 70),a
strain of cynicism begins to make itself heard that is foreign to

were yet but occasional (c. 68. r 35 ff). At another moment

he appeals in remonstranee and grief to the friends who have
become his rivals (cc. 73, 77, 90).

22. And his perturbed soul was still further wrenehed by ’
another heavy blow that fell upon him at about the same time
with these disclosures. His dearly loved brother was dead,
and, to heighten the anguish of the moment, dead far away in

the Troad, without a single relative near him to close his eyeS,
utter the last formal farewell, and place upon his tomb the
customary funeral offerings. The news either reached Catullus
when on a visit to his father’s house at Verona, or summoned
