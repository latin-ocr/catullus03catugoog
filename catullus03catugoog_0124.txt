CATULLUS.

Et magis magis indies et horas.

Quem tu, quod minimum facillimumque est,
5 Qua solatus es adlocutione?

Irascor tibi. Sic meos amores?

Paulum quid libet adlocutionis,

Maestius lacrimis Simonideis.

39.

Egnatius, quod candidos habet dentes,
Renidet usque quaque. Si ad rei uentum est

other hand, Cic. Fam. XVI. p. 1 cum
metiamte tibi esset (to Tiro, eft ill at
Patrae). - Cornifici: see lntr. 61.

2. laboriose: used of physical
suffering ; cf. Cic. Phil. XI. 4. 8
dolores maiores quos laboriosos sole·
mus dicere.

3. magis magis: cl. the same
phrase in 64. 274, and Verg. Geor.
IV. 311; but more commonly as in
68. 48- in dies et horasr cs.
Bell. Afr. 1. somnes in dies ‚loras-
que parati. ¹ ι Ι
..tantillulastall}
quod indignum est.

6. meos amores: notofn er-
son (cto. 16 n.), but os the alec-
tion itsell: ‘is it thus yon treat my
love ior you?’ Cf. 64. 27 n. With
the ellipsis os the verb in a question
of surprise cf. Cic. Ate. Xlll. ²4
nihil igitur neci quidem littera·
rum?

7. paulum quid libet, just one
little word (Ellis); with the ellipsis
os the imperative cf. 55. ro (sc. red-
dite); Ter. And. 204 bona uerba,
quaeso (sc. dicas).

8. maestius, and let it be sadder,
-for Catullus is so disconsolate
that he has ceased to desire encour-

agement, and yearns only lor what
is in accordance with his own mood.
-lacrimis Simonideis= Simoni·
des (ἥδ-467 s.c.), the celebrated
poet o Ceos, excelled especially in
plaintive themes, and so won even
from Aeschylus the prize offered lor
an elegy upon the Athenians who
tell at Marathon.

86. Egnatius, who was singled
ont for especial attaclr in 37. 17-20,
{ltalssrlll‘ll‘nlthl ξὲἑὶἓ
on the continual grin of Canius
Rufus (ΙΙΙ. 20). The poem was
doubtless written at about the same
timp as 37, and the metres are iden·
tica.

1. candidos habet dentes: cf.
37.19-2o.

2. rei subsellium, the desend-
ant’s bench,· cs. Cael. ap. Cic. Fam.
VllI. 8. 1 inuocatus ael subsellia ret'
occurro. Egnatius was one ol the
friends gathered (aduocati) to lend
the defendant their support at the
trial, and ought to have assumed
the expression of countenance thar
would have accorded with the pa·
thetic character ol the counsel’s
speech and have aided in influenc·
ing the judges,— but he grins.
