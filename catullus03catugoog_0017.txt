xii INTRODUCI’ION.

oi lise in the capital during this most active period in the his·
tory oi Rome, there arose a school of writers who, though often
conservatives in politics‚ were radicals in poetry. The tenden-
cies of the traditione] Romaupast were by them utterly disre-
garded. Inspiration was drawn from the stirring life into which
they were plunged, as well as from the sympathetic study oi
the sources os poetic art among both the earlier Greeks and
the Alexandrians. As' was to be expected, their models oi
rhythm were not the rude hexameters and ruder Satumians of
their Roman predecessors‚ but the more polished versification
of the Greeks 3 and their subjects were sometimes their own
personal experiences arrd emotions, and sometimes themes sug·
gested by their Greek prototypes. So a new school oi Roman
poetry arose and flourished, to ¹be superseded in turn by the
[polished Augustans, who cultivated the niceties of elegance, but
'at the expense oi verae.

Carumrs

3. Of this new school oi' poets the most prominent and
interesting figure is Catullus. It is possible to know him per-
sonally as only now and then an ancient writer can be known

to us, and yet he gives us but few definite biographical facts
conceming himself, while still severare given by other authors
,of his own and later ages. But the little body oi' poems that
constitute his extant works is so replete with his intense person-
ality, and shows forth so unreservedly his every emotion, that
the man stands out before us as does no other man os the age
with the exception of two or three oi its political leaders. And
all this is true, even though we acknowledge, as we are bound
to do, thatin many questions oi importance conceming his lise
we must be content with aworking hypothesis instead of a
series os established facts, and that the biographer, as the
interpreter os the poems of Catullus, must be understood to be
presenting probabilities, and not certainties.
