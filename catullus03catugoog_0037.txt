these proffers now made to him through, and by, Furius and
Aurelius were definitely and disdainfully rejected (c. 11),—
with a manly, not a petulant disdain, for Catullus could not
even then iorget that he had loved Lesbia.

⁴²· This manly utterance was almost the last os the poet’s
lise. A few scattered verses there may have been, closing per·
haps with the touching appeal written from Verona (cf. ξ 56)
to his brother-poet, ComificiuS, ior aword of consolation, but
that was all; and sometime in the year 54 a.c., in his beloved
Rome, so says the chronicler, the swiitly buming candle of his
life bumed itsels out.

, ever listed in Rome. He lacked the losty grandeur os Lucre-
tius, the polished stateliness ‚oi Vergil, the broad sympathies
oi Horace. For on the one hand, he was no recluse to be
filled with heavenly visions, and on the other, his personality ’
was too intense to allow him to cultivate a tolerant spirit. He
delighted in life with a vigo'rous animal passion. Not without
charm to him was nature in her sylvan aspect (ci. eg. a. 34. 9 ft),
yet his highest enjoyment was in the lile· oi men. And this life
he did not study, as did Horace, from thezstandpoint oi a
philosopher. Indeed, he did not study it at all, but simply felt
it. For he was not outside os it, but a part of it to the iullest
degree, swayed by its ever-changiug emotions. Such a nature
mustos necessity ever remain in many essential aspects the
nature os a child. And such was the-nature oi Catullus
throughout his brief lise,—warm in quick affections, hot in

swilt hatreds, pulsing with most active red blood.

' 44· The great majority os ms verses-au the most suc-
cessful of them-are the direct expression os his own heart
at the moment. No poet was ever more unreserved‚ more
persectly ingenuous. And yet, such is the sacility os his genius

and the excellence oi his taste, his verses show no ruggedness
