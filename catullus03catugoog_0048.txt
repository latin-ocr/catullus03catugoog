in 47 (cf. Bell. Asr. 96). In 62 nc. Manlius prosecuted P.
Cornelius Sulla on the charge of conspiracy with Catiline.

Cicero and Hortensius appeared for the defence and secured
an acquittal. In Cicero's speech on that occasion (Pro
Sulla), and especially in his Bmtus (76. 265), Manlius is
highly praised. ’

68. A certain Veranius is mentioned in cc. 12, 28, and 47
in connection with a Fabullus, evidently an intimate friend of
his, as both were of Catullus. Beside these three references to
them jointly, c. 9 is addressed to Veranius alone, and c. 13 to
Fabullus alone, the equal recognition thus scmpulously given
them by Catullus suggesting the existence ,of a close bond of
intimacy between the two friends. Nothing more is known of
them than can be gathered from Catullus himself. Veranius
has in c. 9 just returned from a residence in Spain, and in c. 12
the presence there of Fabullus also is noted. The 13th poem,
too, a jesting reference to a prospective dinner offered Fabullus,
appears to have been written while Fabullus was absent sorne-
where, or had just returned, and may well refer to the same
occasion as c. 9, the different tone of the individual poems, one
sportive‚ and one affectionate, corresponding to characteris·
tic differences in the dispositions of the two friends. ln cc.
28 and 47 Veranius and Fabullus have been away from Rome
as members of the retinue of a certain Piso, a provincial gov-
ernor. They returned to Rome apparently not long after the
time of the return of Catullus himself from Bithynia (56 B.c.;
cf. ξ 31 ft).

69. If, then, there be such a connection as indicated be·
tween cc. 9 and 13, the absence in Spain cannot have been that
with Piso, and must have preceded it by several years; for the
reference to Lesbia inc. 13. 11 clearly antedates the break
of Catullus with her, and that occurred before his joumey to ’
Bithynia. But it is not incredible that two friends so inti·
mately connected as Veranius and Fabullus should have been
together on more than one joumey after fortune ; and the
