possessed avilla at Sirmio on the shore os Lacus Benacus near
Verona (c. 31) ; he was acquainted with Veronese society (cc.
67, 100); and he⁴ spent part of his time at Verona (cc. 35,
68 ⁰).

6. The year ol his birth and that ol his death are stated by
Jerome in his edition ol the Chronicles ol Eusebius, probably
on the authority ol the De Poetis ol Suetonius. Under date ol
the year ol Abraham 1930 (=13.C. 87) Jerome says, Gaius
Valerius Catullus scn'ptm lyricus Veronae nascitur, and under
that of 1960, or, according to some MSS, 1959 (= nc. 57, or
58), he says, Catullus XXX. uetanis anna Romae mon'tur.
There is nothing to contradict Jerome’s date lor the birth ol
the poet, but unfortunately lor our heliel in his entire accuracy,
a number os the poems of Catullus were clearly written later
than nc. 57, —some of them at least as late as the end of the
year 55 nc, or the beginning ol the year 54 (eg. cc. 11, 29, 5 3,
113). Jerome is, therefore, certainly wrong about the date ol
the poet’s death, and hence about at least oue ol the two other
statements, the date ol his birth and his age at death. The
only serap ol evidence from other sources on these points is the
vague statement of Ovid that Catullus died young (Am. 111. 9.
62 abusus lrut'c [in Elysio] hedera iuuenalia cinctm tempora
cum Caluo, docte Catulle, aua).

7. The poems ol Catullus himself lumish us, however, with
some good negative evidence concerning the date os his death.
It probably occurred in the year 54 nc. In the first place,
there are no poems that clearly must have been written later
than the close ol the year 55 ne, or the earlier months ol the ·
year 54, nor any that are even capable of more ready explana·
tion, isa later date lor their composition he supposed. The re-
mark about the consulship of Vatinius (c. 52), which did not
take place till the end ol the year 47 nc, forms no exception
to this statement (ci. Commentary)„and the prosecution oi
