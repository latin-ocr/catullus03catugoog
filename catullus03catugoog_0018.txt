4. With regard to his full name· we are len ih some doubt
He refers to himself by name in his poems twenty-five times,

Ἴ but in each case only by the cognomen, Catellnnwhile the

better manuscripts of his writings are inscribed simply canui
Veronensis Liber. Yet there is no difficulty in ascertaining his
gentile name from other writers. Varro (L. L. VII. 50), Sue-
tonius (Iul. 73), Porphyrio (on Hor. Sat. 1. 10. 19), Charisius
(I. 97), Jerome (Clrron. a. Abr. 1930), all give it as Valentius.
There are fewer references to his praenomen. F our of the later
and interpolated manuscripts give it in their titles as Quintus,
and until lately it was supposed that to this indication might be
added the testimony of the elder Pliny (N. H. XXXVII. 81).
Relying upon such authority Scaliger went so far as to emend
c. 67. ra so as to bring in for the unintelligible words qni te
the praenomen of the poet in the vocative, Que'nte,· and his
suggestion won the approval of even so keen a critic as Lach-
mann. But it is now universally conceded that¹ the initial Q.
prefixed to the word Catullus in the passage specihed from
Pliny is an interpolation, the best MS., the codex Bamber·
gensis, containing only the cognomen without prefix. There is,
moreover, positive evidence in favor of a different praenomen.
Jerome (l.c.), in speaking of the birth of the poet, calls him in
full C. Vakn'us Catullus, and Apuleius (Apol. ro), whose ac-
curacy, however, in the matter of names is not above suspicion,
calls him C. Catrellus. In the face, then, oi the testimony
of· interpolated manuscripts only, his praenomen must stand
established as Gaius. ’
