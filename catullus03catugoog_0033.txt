it at Amastris rather than at the seaport of Nicaea. And all this¹
indeed, may be true, in spite of the lact that c. 46 apparently
speaks ol N icaea as the point ol his immediate departure home
ward; for various reasons might be suggested to account for a
Journey to the eastern part ol the province alter bidding Nicaea
a final harewell.
36. In c. 46. 6 the poet speaks of a plan ol visiting claras
Arriae urbes on his return voyage. He seems also to feel some
’ joy at the prospect; but this is the only passage in his writings
tlrat shows any susceptibility to the charm of historic associa·
tions connected with the ancient Greek cities. The course ol
the homeward voyage is but vaguely sketched in c. 4, and the
only city actually mentioned there as visited on the joumey is
Rhodes (c. 4. 8), though we may inser from c. 46 that other
famous sites between the Hellespont and Rhodes were not

neglected by him. He may even have visited Athens, ior his ¹

little ship probably was drawn across the Corinthian isthmus by

the famous ship-railway instead ol braving the dangers os the ,

longer and rougher passage around the Malean cape. Yet no
such mention ol Athens exists in his writings as would suggest
that he had ever visited, or cared to visit, that city. A similar
doubt besets the question of his point ol deharkation in Italy.
If the expressions of c. 4 were to be taken literally‚ we must
understand that the phasellus carried its master actually up the
Po and the little Mincius into the Cardu-lake, even to the
shores of Sirmio itself. But this is well-nigh impossible; and
even if possible, is it likely that the poet, so eager to reach
home, would have submitted to the tedium of a tow-boat’s
voyage (for surely the phasellus could not sail up the Mincius),
when a few hours by post from the mouth ol the Po would have
brought him to his desired haven? Apparently both the begin-
ning and the end of the voyage of the phasellus as recounted
in c. 4 are not to be interpreted with strict literalness. But the
rapturous joy with which Sirmio is saluted in c. 31 forbids us
to suppose that the poet first visited Rome, and later made his
