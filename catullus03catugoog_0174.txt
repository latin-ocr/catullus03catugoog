Cybele. The centre ol the worship
oi the Phrygisn Κυβέλη or Κυβήβη,
was in very ancient times the town

ducted by emasculated priests called
Galli (or‚asin vv. 12and 34,with
reference to theirphysical condition, ·
Gallae). Their name was derived
by the ancients from that of the
river Gallus, a tributary oi the San-
garius, by drinking from which men
became inspired with frenzy (cf. Ov.
Fastlv. 361 ft). The worship
was orgiastic in the extreme, and
was accompanied by the sound ol
such fremy-producing instruments
as the tympana, cymbala, tibiae,end
cornu, and culminated in scourging,
seli-mutilation, syncope from excite·

orthage or beart-lallare (ci. Lucr.
11. 598 ff.; Varr. Sat. Men. 131 ff.
Biich.; 0v.Fast.1v. 179 il). The
worship oi the Magna Mater, or
Mater Idaeaas she was osten called

Rhesos the Cretan Mt. Ida rather
than from the Trojan Mt. lde),
was introduced into Rome in 205

of Pessinos in Galatian Phrygia, at ne. in accordance with a Sibylline
