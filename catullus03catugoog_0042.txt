died before 1330),celebrated in a few enigmatic verses (cf.
Critical Appendix ad fin.) the rediscovery oi the text os Catul-
lus ‘under a bushel‚' apparently at Verona. From this MS,
or irom copies os it, numerous Italian scholars, among them
Petrarch, early learned to know the poet. ‘lhe original MS.
soon disappeared, and has never been found, but two descend-
ants oi it, apparently not more than one generation removed,
are preserved to us, and sorm the basis of the present text oi
Catullus. One oi these copies, 'ordinarily called G (now No.
14,r 37 in the National Library at Paris) was made in the year
1375, and the other, 0 (No. 30 oi the Canonici Latin MSS. in
the Bodleian Library) at about the same time. (cf. also intro-
ductory note to Critical Appendix.)

54. The earlier editions of Catullus, however, were based
upon interpolated MSS, and though displaying great enidition
and classical taste left much to be desired in the way oi true
principles os textual criticism. The edition of Karl Lachmann
(Berlin, 1829) first established the text os Catullus upon a
scientific basis, though the two MSS. on which he mainly
depended‚ D and L (in the Royal Library at Berlin), are sar
inferior to G and 0. These became first known to the world,
G in 1830 through Ι. Sillig (Jahrb. fiir Plu‘lol. xiii. p. 262 fi),
and Othrough Robinson Ellis in his first edition os Catullus
(Oxsord, 1867). During the last quarter os a century, then,
the constitution as well as the elucidation ol the textos Catullus
has made its most marked advances.

55. A few os the persons distinguished by the love or by the
hatred of Catullus may conveniently be mentioned here. Some
such personS, however, as Caesar, Cicero, and Clodius, are so
well knowm otherwise to the ordinary reader as to need no
biographical notice in a work of this sort. Others, like Lesbia,
have been sufficiently noticed in previous paragraphs oi this
Introduction. Still others are of so little present importance,
