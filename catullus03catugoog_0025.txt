attractions. The exclusive demand his love made upon het
¹ grew irksome. He might be so wholly swallowed up in love
for her as to disregard everything else, but she was not so
in love with him. It flattered her vanity to hold him thus
in thrall, butwas tiresome if she also must have her freedom
limited by the same shackles. And so she gradually turned

restored to their old footing. Neither of them felt prehisely as
before. Lesbia had no intention of confining herself to Catullus
