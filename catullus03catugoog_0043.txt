orare so little known to us outside the mention of them by
Catullus, that the brief references to them in the commentary
on the individual poems may suffice. The names of all these,
with references to the poems in which they are addressed or
mentioned, may be found in the Index of Proper Names at
the end of this volume.

56. Itis a temptation to identify the Alfenus to whom the
remonstrance of c. 30 is addressed with P. Alfenus Varus, consul
suffectus 39 ne, especially if he, in turn, can be identified with
the Alfenus Varus who protected Vergil’s property at Mantua
ἵ (Ecl. 1, 6, 9), who was perhaps a native of Cremona (though
falsely identified by the scholiasts on Horace with Alfenus unser
of Sat. 1. 3. 130). For if Varus was at Cremona during the
winter and spring of 5 5-54 ac, while Catullus was at Verona

(cf. 540), we perhaps have a key to the difference in tone ζ
between c. 30 and c. 38. From Comificius at Rome the poet l
could expect in his growing illness only written comfort, and¹ that ζ
is all he asks. Alfenus Varus at Cremona was within easy reach- 1
ing distance of Verona by a direct highway, the Via Postumia, '

and might have visited Catullus in person, but did not. Hence
the deeper feeling of slight with which Catullus addresses him.

57. The ‘Pollio frater’ of c. 12. 6 is very likely the only
Pollio known to us from this period, C. Asinius, Cn. f. (born
75 nc, died 5 an), who became praetor in 45 ne. and consul
in 40, in which year he gained a triumph over the Parthini. At
first a Caesarian, he might have been won over to the senato-
rial party after Caesar’s death, but finally cast in his lot with
Antonine, from whom, however, he became alienated‚ but
without entering the circle of the intimate friends of Augustus.
As orator, dramatic and lyric poet, historian of the first trium-
vitate, and literary critic, he gained lasting fame, and is fre·
quently quoted by succeeding writers. Among his intimate
friends were Vergil and Horace; cf. Verg. Ecl. 3. 843 45 8. 6;
Hor. Carm. II. 13 Sat. I. 10. 42, 85.

58. Nothing further is known of the older brother of Pollio
