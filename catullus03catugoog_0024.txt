faintness that seizes upon him even while he feels himself a
god, and more than a god, iu sharing her smile and her voice.
And with the swift passion comes the mad desire to win her
love. Lesbia is a married woman (c. 83. 1), but that consider·
ation demands only additional care and diplomacy on his part,
and is no bar to his efforts. He lays siege to her heart. His
importunate persistence, youth as he is, commands her attention
even amid a throng of lovers, but apparently only irritates her.
What does this youngster, lately come to Rome, hope for amid
so many of his betters? He sees that victory must be won over
this brilliant woman of the world by proving himself no mere
moon-calf. Therefore he curbs his sentiment, and matches wit
with wit. Even her own display of petulance is turned against

But not even the possibility of discovery restrained the ardor of
the poet’s soul. He poured forth his feelings most simply and
unrestrainedly in aseries of charming trifles. Mete childlike
delight in multitudinous kisses (cc. 5, 7), daintiest pretence of
lover's jealousy at the favors accorded Lesbia’s sparrow (c.' a),
gentle, half-smiling sympathy with her over the untimely death
of her pet (c. 3), flow from his pen with a perfect freedom of
movement and yet with an exquisite grace and perfectiou in
every part. And the mere thought that any proud damsel could
once claim comparison with his lesbia rouses him to hot scoru

attractive to Lesbia, but it could not take the place ofall other
