addressed io c. 12. 'Ihe family of the Asinii sprang from Teate,
the capital of the Marrucini, but it is doubtful whether Marru-
cine in c. 12. 1 is simply a distinguishing epithet. C. Asinius
Pollio is the first of the family known to bear a cognomen, and
perhaps that custom was introduced in his generation, his elder
brother taking the cognomen Marrucinus from the seat of the
family.

59. The Caelius of c. 58 is probably identical with the Caelius
of cc. 82 and roo, and with the Rufus of cc. 69 and 77 (aud also
cc. 73 and 59i), the names and circumstances suggesting M.
Caelius Rufus, born, according to Pliny (N. H. VII. 165), on
the same day with C. Licinius Calvus, May 28, 82 ac. (though
perhaps this date is too late, by a few years, for the birth of

being shortly thereafter deposed for attempts at revolutionary
legislation, he tried to seduce certain of Caesar’s troops, and
was finally killed under the walls of Thurii. He was an active
and interesting correspondent of Cicero, by whom he was de· ,

charge of attempted poisoning brought by Clodia (Lesbia),
whose favored lover he had been. He himself appears to have
broken this connection, and perhaps to have opened the eyes
of Catullus to Lesbia’s real character, after· which the friend-

been severed by their rivalry (cf. ξς 25, 26). The poems
