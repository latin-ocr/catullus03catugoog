rhythms Then follows the group of longer poems (ιι. 61-
68⁶), introduced by the three epithalamia (ιι. 61, 62, 64), with
their Eros accompanied by the Anteros of c. ⁶33 this group oi
poems begins with glyconics (ι. 61), continues with dactylic
hexameters (cc. 62, 64), divided by passionate galliambics (ι.
63), and concludes with elegiacs (ιι. 65-68‘). It is followed
by a third group of shorter poems (ιι. 69-116), all in the

elegiae metre, but as varied in theme as the first group. This
division was suggested entirely by the metres and length of the
poems, and not at all by their subject-matter; for the third
group contains poems agreeing in subject and date with others
in the first group (cf. eg. c. 99 with ι. 48, ι. 81 with ι. 24, ι. 93
with cc. 29 and 57). Within each group poems on the same or
similar themes occasionally stand together (ag. cc. a and 3 ς ιι.
61 and 623 cc. 88-915 cc. rro and 111), but more frequently
are divided by one or more poems on another, and osten e
contrasted theme (cf. cc. 5 and 73 ιι. ar and 23 ; ιι. 62 and
64 3 ιι. 69 and 713 ιι. 70 and 72).

49. The editor certainly included one mere ,fragment (ι.
58⁶); and perhaps more of the poems whose condition we
attribute to the neglect of a later age (ag. ιι. 2. 11-133 14⁵ 3
54 ; 78⁵) may have been published by him in their present
form, on account of his anxiety to omit no serap found among
his friends posthumous papers.

50. Another possibility suggests itself. The editor certainly
must have disregarded what would have been the wishes of
Catullus in publishing, or republishing, the poems against cesar,
especially if none had yet been written in his favor. The edi·
tor was doubtless one of the circle of literary friends of the
poet at Rome, and so was, if not, lilre Catullus,a subject of
sudden conversion, an anti-Caesarian. Is it possible that he
still further used his discretim, and served his own sympathies,
by refraining from the publication oi later poems favorable to

Caesar, and that by this theory, and not by that of the speedy ‚

death of the poet, we are to explain the absence in his works
