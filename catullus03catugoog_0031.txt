brother (cf. ξ 22). In the second place, he had been passing
through a terrible mental struggle that was perhaps not yet over,
and Rome had become painful to him. In the distraction of
travel and residence in a foreign clime he might find that
absence from himself for which he sighed.

30. How he obtained the appointment we do not know, for
there is no earlier reference to Memmius in his poems, and
none but uncomplimentary references to him later. But itis
not strange that with all his circle of literary friends at Rome he

should command influence enough to secure such a post; nor ’

is it strange that C. Memmius, himself a learned man and a

verse-writer (Cic. Bmt. 70. 2473 Ov. Trist. II. 4333 Plin. Ep. ÷

V. 3. 5 ; Gell. XIX. 9. 7), was pleased to have the company in

save in the one poem (c. ror) in which he commemorates the

speaks the last farewell, —a farewell of infinite sadness because
spoken with· no hope ofa future reunion. To make these
offerings of pious affection was one of the motives of Catullus
in coming to this distant land, aud doubtless the sad duty was
not long postponed after his arrival there. What were the
other occupations of his lise in Bithynia we cannot tell. No
poems remain, at any rate, to mark the pleasures of social
intercourse, no squibs of raillery, no brilliant bits of fancy,
such as distinguish the Roman days of the poet. The year is
along silence. Perhaps he was too sad to write3 perhaps
the irksomeness and dulness of his official life wore hard
upon his Muse3 perhaps, however, he was gathering inspira·
tion from their native scenery and legend for those poems ol
