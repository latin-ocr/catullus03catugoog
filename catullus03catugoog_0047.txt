which a part, with lives of Cato andos Atticus, is still extant, ,

but also of other historica} works (cf. c. 1. 6 n.) 3ηά of poems i
(Ptin. Ep. V. 3. 6).
65. Q. Hortensius Ortalus (114-50 nn), Cicero's greatest

rival as an orator, was also somewhat of a historian <Veli 11. ¹
16. 3), and wrote erotic poems (Ov. Tn'st. II. 441 ; Plin. Ep. ¹
V. 3. 5), which the Greeks at the banquet of Antonius Julianus ’
(Gell. XIX. 9. 7) characterized as invenusta, though they l

admitted that Catullus and Calvus wrote some verses compara·
ble with those of Anacreon. Ptesuming, perhaps, upon his own
gifts as a poet, Hortensius asked Catullus for a poem (c. 65.
18-19), and the poet complied with the request, though with
an absence of compliment that indicates no intimate friendship
with his petitioner, whose much greater age and high position
gave him, however, the power to become an influential patron.
That the friendship made no progress seems to be indicated by
the uncomplimentary allusion to the verses of Hortensius in
c. 95. 3 (cf. however § ²5 odfin). ’

66. The Varus of c. 10 is apparently identical with the Varus
of c. 33, who is a friend of Catullus and a criticos poetry, if not
a poet himself. This may well be the distinguished Quintilius
Varus, the¹ Augustan critic (Hor. A. P. 438 ff.) and poet (Acro
and Comm. Cruq. on l.c.). He is called a native of Cre·
mona 3 and his death in ²3 rac. (according to Jerome) drew
from Horace a touching address of sympathy to Vergil (Carm.
I. 34). Judged from the tone of the passage in the Ars
Poert'ca, Quintilius must have been somewhat older than
Horace, while yet he could hardly have been born long, if at
all, before Catullus. The attempt to identify the Varus of c. 10
and c. 22 with Alfenus Varus of c. 30 is unsatisfactory.

67. The Manlius Torquatus, whose marriage with Vinia
Aurunculeia is celebrated in c. 61, was perhaps the L. Manlius
Torquatus whose father was consul in 65 nc. (cf. Hor. Carm.
III. 21.1; Epod. 13. 6), 3ηά who was himself praetor in 49.

He allied himself with me Pompeians, and was killed in Africa ᾗ
