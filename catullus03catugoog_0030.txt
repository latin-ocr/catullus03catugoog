Lesbia, and many minor details ol reference in the poerns of

Catullus are thus explicable. Especially it may be noted that
Μ. Caelius Rufus (cl. cc. roo, 77, 69, 58) was a lover of this
Clodia (cl. Cic. Cael. passim) about the year '58 ac, and

expense oi the provincials in one ol the dozen ways possible
under a friendly and not too conscientious official patron.
Catullus apparently had not been poverty-stricken, however
jestingly he claimed that common distinction os the society-man
at the capital, though an increase oi income may not have been
without attractione lor him. He had up to this time, too,
apparently loved Rome above all other cities, and had not
cared to leave it sor any considerable period os time, even that
he might visit Greece. But now there were two motives that
might lead him to look with desire upon a joumey to Bithynia.
In the first place, it offered him an opportunity to visit the
Troad and to pay the final offerings of love at the grave of his
