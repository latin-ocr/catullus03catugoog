Vatinius by Calvus, mentioned in c. 53, may well have taken
place in 56 ae, instead of in the fall of 54. Furthermore,
c. 11, which was surely written toward the close of 55 B.c.,
shows a decided change iu the feeling of Catullus toward
Caesar, and accords well with the statement of Suetonius (Iul.
73), that after Catullus had angered Caesar by his epigrams
conceming him and Mamurra, a reconciliation with the poet

took place, apparently at his father's house at Verona. It is
hardly credible that if Catullus lived during the exciting years
that followed, 55 ae, the only indication of 'his new feeling
toward Caesar should be the reference iu 'c. 11, and that this
was followed by silence. Such neutrality was‘not the fashion
among the young friends whom Caesar was constantly winning
to himself from the ranks of his political opponents. Tbere
seems, indeed, to be an indication in c. 11 that Catullus might
be expecting some post under the great commander. But the
most satisfactory conclusion is that death came within a short
time after the close of 55 ac, and anticipated all hoped·for
activities (cf, however, ξ 5ο).

8. Whether Jerome is wrong in one or in both of his other
statements, remains, and must always remain, in doubt. All
known facts conceming Catullus harmonize well with the
hypothesis that he was born in 87, and died in 54 aro, at
the age of thirty-three, or that he was born in 84, and died
in 54, at the age of thirty; but nothing more definite can be
said about the matter.

9. The only relative mentioned by Catullus is his bmther,
whose death was the occasion to him of such intense and last·
ing grief (cc.·65, 68, τοι). But Suetonius (lc.) speaks of the
father as a host of Julius Caesar even so late, apparently, as the
close of the poet’s life. Why he (to say nothing of the mother)
is never mentioned by the poet, we cannot tell. Not improb-
ably, however, he did not have the same active sympathy with
