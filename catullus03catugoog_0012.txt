PREFACE.

-οοο-

uua text of this edition of Catullus is constituted upon the
conviction that only cadim Sangermanensis (G) and Oxom'-
emis (0) are of ultimate authority in determining the readings
of the lost codex Veronensis (V), and that the readings of the
other known MSS. (except T) that differ from those of G and
0 have the value of conjectura] emendations merely.

In the Critical Appendix are exhibited in full the readings of
G and 0, with the omission, however, of such as present only
unimportant orthographical peculiarities. For the readings of
G Ι have depended mainly upon the published collations ol
Baehrens, Ellis, and Schwabe (in his last edition), together with
the photolithographic fac-simile of the MS. published at Paris in
1890. For the readings of 0 I have followed a collation and
complete transcript of that MS. made by nre in July, 1889, by
the courtesy of the Librarian of the Bodleian. This collation
was carefully compared on the spot with the collations of Ellis
and Schwabe, and is therefore, I trust, reasonably free from error.

A fac-simile of a page of codex O, reduced one-third in siae,
follows this preface.

My especial thanks are due to the editors-in-chief of this
Series for their unfailing kindness and invaluable criticisms,
and to my friend and associate, Mr. Frank W. Nicolson, for
his assistance in proofreading and in the preparation of the

Critical Appendix. Ε Τ M
