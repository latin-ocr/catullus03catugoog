his matured genius, cc. 63 and 64, and had even then begun
to block them out. When they were published cannot be
determined.

32. Life in Bithynia was surely unsatisfactory from a finan-
cial point of view. The cobwebs in the poet’s pockets were
not displaced by gold. Perhaps the shrewder men on the staff
learned better how to make hay while their brief sun was shin·
ing. Catullus, however, came back home poor, and blamed
Memmius for it. But whether Memmius really deserved the
exceedingly opprobrious epithets heaped upon him (cf. cc. 10,
28) may well be doubted. Virulence of language in invective,
especially in the use of terms applied to sexual impurity‚ was
by no means accompanied among the ancients by correspond-
ing intensity of feeling, and is often to be understood as formal
and not literal.

33. Yet some pleasures in his Bithynian life Catullus must
have experienced 3 for when on the approach of spring (56
ne.) he bids his companions adieu, it is with a tribute to the
delight he has taken in their company (c. 46.9 dulces comi·
tum coetus), and a reference perhaps to the expected pleasure
of a reunion with them in Italy (c. 46. 10-11).

34. But the pain of parting was very insignificant in com·
parison with the overwhelming joy of home-coming. The ex-
quisite grace of the two sparrow·songs of Catullus (cc. 2, 3)
is matched by the most perfect delight that breathes through
the pair of poems (cc. 46, 31) that mark the beginning and
the end of his homeward voyage. They stand supreme among
the poems of home that have come down to us from antiquity‚
thrilling and quivering with purest and most childlike passion
With this pair of poems probably belongs a third (c. 4), which
followed speedily upon the two others.

35. The third of the triad (c. 4) indicates that Catullus
made this return voyage in a small vessel of Amastriac build
purchased by him for this purpose. It almost seems from his
account as if it were built to his order, and that he embarked in
