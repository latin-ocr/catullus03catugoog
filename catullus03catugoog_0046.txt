less probability may be attributed to him the work on the deri·
vation of the names os the gods ascribed by Macrobius and
Priscian to an author oi his name: but the verse in criticism
oi a grammatica] point in Vergil attributed by Cledonius (V.
43. 2) to Cornificius Gallus may have been written, as some
have thought, by Cornelius Gallus Only two fragments os the
verses of Cornificius have been preserved, one a hendecasylla-
bic (Macr. VI. 4. ra), and the other the latter part ol a
hexameter from his Glaucus (Macr.V1.5. 13). They are
appended by L. Mulier to his edition oi Catullus.

62. The Cato to whom c. 56 is addressed was probably not
that pattem of ancient Roman strictness, M. Porcius Cato,
later called Uticensis, but ..the grammarian, Valerius Cato, who .
was a countryman' of Catullus (Suet. Gram. rr) , and whose
amatory poems are mentioned by Ovid (Tn'st. 11. 436) in
connection with those oi Cinna (ci. 6 63), Comilicius (ci.
ἕ 61), and Anser.

63. C. Helvius Cinna, a companion oi Catullus on the stad

Zmyrna, is praised in c. '9 5, was probably the Caesarian tribune
mistaken for L. Cornelius Cinna, the anti-Caesarian, in the riots
attending the funeral oi Julius Caesar, and killed by the popu·
lace (Plut. Bmt. πο, Iul. 683 Suet. Iul. 853 cf. Shaksperesul.
Cas. III. 3). The insignificant extant fragments of hispoems
are appended by L. Mtiller to his edition of Catullus.

64. The Cornelius of c. 1. r seems to be Cornelius Nepos, the
historian 3 witness Ausonius, who says (XXIII. 1-3) ‘Cui . .. ‚
libellum ’ Veronensis aitpoeta quondam, irruenteque dedit statim

Nepoti. Nepos (circ. 94-24 nc.) was certainly a provincial ‚

from Cisalpine Gaul (Plin. N. H. 111. 127 Nepos Padi accola),
and pmbably a native os Ticinum (Plin. Ep. IV. 28. 13
Mommsen in Hermes ΙΙΙ. p. 62). His acquaintance with
Catullus, though nothing certain can be traced concaming it,
was doubtless sostered by their similarity os origin (cs. § η).
Nepos was author not only oi the work De Vim Illustn‘hus, ol
