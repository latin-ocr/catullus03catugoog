m INTRODUCI'ION.

(5⁶ nc.) had witnessed the socalled renewal of the triumvirate
at Luca, and Caesar appeared to have won everything. In
accordance with the agreement made at the Luca conference, ¹

Pompey and Crassus were consuls a second time for the ¹

year 5 5, and the senatorial party was at its wits' end. Catullus
was apparently not an active political worker, but he did not
hesitare to join his political friends in personal attacks upon
the foe. Perhaps his earlier shafts were those aimed against
Mamurra (cf. §1 73), Caesar’s notorious favorite (cc. 29, 41,
43, 57), whom Catullus sometimes celebrates under the nick·
name of Mentula (cc. 94, 105,114‚ 115), and these opened
the way for the direct attack upon Caesar himself (cc. 54, 93).
But whatever the order of attack‚ that Caesar was piqued by it
we know from Suetonius (Iul. 73). That he made a success·
ful effort to win over Catullus, as he did Calvus, we are also
assured from the same source. Caesar understood better than
most Romans that political power in that city and that day
must rest largely upon personal popularity, and he was not
above exerting himself to win the good will of individuals of
high or low degree. And aside from the fascination due to
his great political and military success, he had personal traits
that gave him a power over young men. It was the mys-
terious influence of a natural leader of men3 and in many
more than these two instances the number of his friends was
recruited from the ranks of the younger of his hercest foes.
There was another clement also that must have tended to pro-
mote the reconciliation between Caesar and Catullus. The
father of Catullus was resident at Verona within the limits of
Caesar’s Cisalpine province. He may not have taken an active
part in politics, but at any rate he was a personal friend of
Caesar, and often his host (Suet. La). This intimacy may well
have led him to see clearly what the result of the approaching
struggle for supremacy in Rome was likely to be, and to de·
sire the more eagerly to see his son amyed for Caesar and not
against him.
