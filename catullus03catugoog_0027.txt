him suddenly thither from Rome. For a time this emotion
dulled his sensibility to every other. He could think of noth-
ing else. He foreswore the Muses forever, save to express the
burden of his woe (cc. 68. 193 65. 12). To the request of the
influential orator Hortensius for verses, he could send onlya
translation from Callimachus, and the story of his tears. He
must even deny (c. 68⁰) an appeal from his friend Manlius for
consolation on the death of his wife, - perhaps the same Man-
lius for whose happy bridal he had but a short time before
written an exquisite marriage-song (c. 61). And even when

Manlius sought to recall him to Rome by hints conceming the χ

scandal aroused by Lesbia’s misdoings, the only answer was a
sigh (c. 68. 30).

faithless mistress. At all events when, shortly afterward, he ,

did return to the capital, his eyes were fully opened. Not ,

that he now ceased to love Lesbia, for that was beyond his

24. Though he was condemned still to love lesbia, the
former connection with her was now broken off, never to be
renewed. Yet he has for her words of sorrow rather than of
scorn. Even now, as formerly (c. 104), he cannot malign her, .
although she has sunk so deep in degradation. In a simple,
manly way he declares the fidelity of his love for her (c. 87),
and the condition to which he has now been brought by her
fault and nothis own (c. 75). However difficult it be to asso-
ciate the idea of pure affection with a passion like his, there
is, newertheless, an appeal of truth in his solemn asseveration
at this moment of bitterest grief that his love for Lesbia was
not merely the passion of any common man for his paid mis·
taess, but was as the love of a father for his son (c. 72). Not
