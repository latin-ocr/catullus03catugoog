xxiv INTRODUCIION.

and the hope os budding fortune (cli 41), to win him back
to her, his reply was one of bitter scom for her, though joined
with a touch of sorrowlul reminiscence of departed joys.

27. As partos the history os Catullus aster the break with
Lesbia has thus been anticipated in order to indicate the course
os his struggle with himself, it may be well to pause here a lew
moments longer to ask who this Lesbia was. That we have iu
the poems of Catullus a real and not an imaginative sketch ol
a love-episode cannot be once doubted by him who reads.
Lesbia is not a lay figure,a mere peg on which to hang sancies,
like the shadowy heroines os Horace. That she was no liber-
tina, but awoman of education and of social position, is equally

P. Clodius Pulcher, Cicero’s soe, wife of Q. Caecilius Metellus
Celer, who was praetor ne. 63, then governor os Cisalpine
Gaul, consul for the year 60 n.c., and died in 59, not without
suspicion that his wife poisoned him (cf. Cic. Cael. 24. 60 ;
Quint. VIII. 6. 53). Among almost all Catullian scholam oi
the present century this view has found acceptante, in spite
of the express dissent ot* a few. The general character and
