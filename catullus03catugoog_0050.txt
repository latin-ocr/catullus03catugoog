lations irom Callimachus, but declaring lrom tlrat time open
war, while the second asserta that Gellius had broken the bond
oi friendship with Catullus by becuming a lovetot Lesbia. In
c. 80. 1 the youth oi Gellius is indicated, and in all the series
except e. 116 he is charged with various abhorrent crimes The
most acceptable suggestion oi his identity was originally made
by Pantagathus (†1578), who judged him to be that son- oi t. v
Gellius Publicola (consul 72 um) who is said by Valerius
Maximus (V. 9. ι) to have been accused before the senate ol
in nouercam (cl. c. 88. 1, etc.) commissum stuprum et pam’ci·
aium cogitatum. This younger Gellius was himself consul in
3⁶ nc, and his age therefore also accords with the intimations
os Catullus. The patemus oi c. 74 is identified by some critica
with the Gellius Publicola attacked by Cicero in Pro Sestio 51.
110, while yet others have supposed, but with no sufficient rea·
son, that this Gellius, and not the one ol Valerius Maximus, is
the Gellius assailed by Catullus.

73. The attacks oi Catullus upon Mamurra have already
been mentioned (8 38). That he is identical with the ‘Men-
tula' of cc. 94, 105, 114, and 115 we may be tolerably certain
on noting the use oi that name lor Mamurra in c. 29. 13, and on
comparing the wealth and extravagance os the two men (ee.
114 and 115 with ce. 29, 41, and 43), their literary preten-
sions (e. 105 with c. 57. 7), and their licentiousness (cc. 94 and
115. 7-8 with· cc: 29. 7-8 and 57). These latter indicatione,
however, hut 'support' that oi c. ³29. 13,·and would not inde·
pendently establish the identity.

74. A sufficient biography of Mamurra is given by Pliny
(N. H. XXXVI. 6. 48), who says he was an eques of Pormiae
and praefectus fabraene os Caesar in Gaul, and quotes Nepos as η
authority t'or the statement that Mamurra first of the Romans
incrusted the entire walls oi his house on the Caelian with mar-
ble, and had within it none but solid marble columns. Cicero,
τοο, mentions Mamurra’s ill-gotten wealth (Ate. v11. 7. 6), and
in Ate. XIII. 52. 1 (written in 45 nm) refers to the calm way
