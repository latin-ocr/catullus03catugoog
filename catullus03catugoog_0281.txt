Α ἰιιιίιιιίΙι oi iol. 26u.(64. 336-366) by tbe collotype process is given
in the edition oi Catullus by Robinson Ellis (Oxiord, 1878²); lacsimiles oi
iol. tgr. (50. 3-51. 12) aad tol. aon. (63. 57-87) were published by Mr.
Ellis in his XII. Facsimr'les from &dn MSS. in the Bodleian Library
(1885); a reduced iacsimile oi iol. 21 r. follows the prelace to this volume,
and since it has passed through tbe prese a laesimilc oi the mine page by
the beliogrsphic process has come to haud as plate XVa in the Pale'o·
graphie der Classiqmr Latin-s oi M. Chatelain (Paris, 1892).

Codex Sangermanemr's (G), now No.14,1370f the latin MSS.in the

National Library in Paris, formerly No. 1,165 in the library ol tbe abbey
oi st-Germaindeel’res. lts subscription shows it to have been written in
the year 13753 and even ii the words et cetera there occurring are alren
as an indication that its scribe was but copying lrom a longer subscription ol
the year 1375, the style oi the writing shows that this copy could not have
been made much later than that date. Τιιε book contains the works ol
Catullus only, and is described by Schwabe as consisting ol 36 leaves ol
parchment, each 243 centimeters long and 16.9 centimeters wide, with 33
lines oi writing on a page. The last page, however, conmins 34 lines.
The text presents many erasures and corrections, the very large majority ol
which, at any rate, were made either by the original copyist, or by another
not iar removed from him in time. The copyist oi G seems to have been
somewbat more sophisticated than the copyist oi 0, and (as the subscrip·
tion also intimates) to have been more worried about the condition oi the
“ text be was reproducing. The result is that the more ignorant blunders
committed or perpetriated in Oare oiten the better gulde to the readings
oi the common original oi the two MSS. A heliographic lacsimile oi two
adjoining peges oi G, iol. 35 n. and 36 r. (110. 7-116. 8), forms plate XV.
in tlte Paliograplvie des Classiques latins ot M. Chatelain, and the entire

MS. has recently been reproduced in excellent {assimile by a photolitho·
graphic process (Paris, Leroux, 1890), ,,
