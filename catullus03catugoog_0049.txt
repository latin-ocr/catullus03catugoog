Journey to Spain like the laterone with Piso (cl. 5 7ο) may
well have been on the staff ot' a provincial govemor,—prob·
ably about 60 nc, as the reference to Lesbia indicates (cl.
c.1.11n..)

773). The Piso unlavorably commented upon in cc. 28 and 47
(cl. ς 68) rs probably Ι, Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, consul m '
58 nc. (the year os Cicero's exile), and m 57- 55 governor ol ³,

Macedonia, where he made an honorable record. Alter his re· '

turn to Rome m 5 5 nc. he attempted to reply to certain stric-
tures os Cicem uttered in his absence, and drew down upon
himself the overwhelming invective power ol his adversary in
the famous speech In lironem, in which the whole lile, char-
acter, and actions ol Piso were held up to undeserved obloquy.

71. The service os Catullus on the staff of C. Memmius
governor os Bithynia, has already been discussed (ἕ 29 ff.).

IV. 18. 2), and vas charged with the seduction ol the wives

patron os literary men, especially oi Lucretius, who dedicated
his great poem to him. Cicero (Bruto o.247) speaks well
os his Greek scholarship, and of his ability m oratory, though
blamIng him for lack os application. Accused ol' ambi'ffus m
53 n..,c on account ol' the operations ol the preceding year,
he went into exile tn Greece (cl. Cic. Fam. XIII. 1)‚where he
died about the year 49.

72. Prominent among the invective poems ot' Catullus is a
gmup directed against a certain Gellius. This comprises cc. 74,
80, 88, 89, 90, 91, 116, but the poems are not arranged in
chronological order. Apparently the earliest ln composition is
c. 116, and the second c. 91, -the first indicating that Catullus
