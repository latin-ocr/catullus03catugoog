37. But even Sirmio could not long detain him lrom his loved
Rome. His reappearance among his old friends is marked by
a single poem (c. 10),whose gay and charming humor shows
that even the vicinity os Lesbia had lost its power constantly
to emhitter his thoughts. And to the passion lor Lesbia now
appears to have succeeded that lor a boy, Juventius with the
charms of whose company Catullus perhapsattempted to drive
out the thoughts os his former love. How the intimacy began
we cannot tell. The Juventian gens sprung from Tusculum,
but inscriptions (C. I. L. vol. V. possein) show that people ol
that name also lived in the neighborhood os Verona. It may be,
therefore, that the boy came to Rome under the guardianship ol
Catullus, as perhaps Catullus, years belore, under that ol Nepos.
But nothing furtheris known os him beyond what may be in·

a pair os friends, Aurelius und Furius, both at first friends ol
Catullus to the former ol whom the poet at one time was led
to entrust temporarily the-care os his ward (c. 15)· The result
might have been anticipated. Juventius learned to prefer them
to Catullus, and in consequence Catullus vented his wrath upon
them in a group ol bitter poems (cc. 16, 21, 23, 26), though lor
Juventius he had only sorrowful remonstrance (cc. 24, 81).
