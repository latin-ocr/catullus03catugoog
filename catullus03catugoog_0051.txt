in which Caesar received news of his death (so Nipperdey inter·
prets the allusion). The connection of Mamurra with the pro-

vincial Ameana (cc. 41, 43) may be assigned to the time when
he was in attendance upon Caesar in his winter joumeys to the
nearer province.

75. The poet Volusius of cc. 36 and 95 is probably not to be
identified with Tanusius Geminus, as Muretus and other later

writers would have it. The only ground for such identification l

is a remark made by Seneca (Ep. 93. 11 avernales Tanusii scis

quam ponderosi sint etquid nocentur). But of all the names χ

that appear in Catullus, Lesbia and Lesbius are the only ones
known to be pseudonyms (for Mentula is hardly a name, but an
easily recognized epithet). And the quid nocentur of Seneca

may readily refer to some other popular characterization of the ¹

work of the annalist, and not to the cacata charia of c. 36. 1.

Marses.

The metres employed by Catullus are as follows ε -

76. Dncrvrrc Hmmwwrsn (ιι. 62, 64) and Eunones (cc. ⁶5-
116). The occurrence of spondaic verses is very frequent, and
doubtless is' due to Alexandrian influence. In all, there are
42 such verses, of which 34 end in a quadrisyllable. In only
ten instances is this a proper name. In c. 64 there is a suc-
cession of three spondaic verses (vv. 78-80).—The tendency
to employa succession of spondees in the same verse is strik-
ing. Thus c. 116. 3 is made up entirely of spondees, and 71
verses have spondees in the first four places—The penthe-
mimeral caesura is by far the favorite, though the hephthe-
mimeral occurs occasionally ; and the feminine caesura in the
third foot is not unknown, though it is entirely excluded from
the fourth-The hexameters end preferably in a dissyllable
or trisyllable, but in the ending of the pentameters greater
freedom is allowed. - Hypermeters are found in c. 64. 298
andc.115.5. On hiatus, see 6 864,
